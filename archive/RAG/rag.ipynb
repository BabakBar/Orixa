And the U.S. \\npopulation overall is forecast to continue aging due to the  ongoing decline \\nin fertility rates  and an  increase in life expectancy , creating a growing base \\nof VMS users and a tailwind for the industry.   \\n• Millennial segment growth:  Millennials have the highest average annual \\nmonthly VMS spend ($70 per month), according to a recent survey \\nconducted by L.E.K. Consulting. Younger generati ons have also had the \\nfastest -growing weekly median earnings compared to older cohorts (ages \\n45+) from 2016 to 2022, demonstrating their increasing purchasing power \\nand making them an attractive target VMS consumer.  \\n• Preventive health:  Healthcare costs cont inue to rise, with the national \\nhealth expenditure anticipated to increase by 5.2% per year from 2022 to \\n2030F. In the meantime, 75% of current healthcare spending is related to \\nchronic diseases, and an incremental 14 million people are expected to \\nhave at  least one chronic condition over the next 10 years. This \\ncombination of  rising healthcare costs  and the  growing prevalence of \\nchronic conditions  is contributing to a  shifting consumer mindset toward \\nprevention.  \\n• Regulatory scrutiny:  The Food and Drug Administration is stepping up its \\nscrutiny of supplements; the number of warning letters sent to supplement \\ncompanies from the agency  more than doubled from 2017 -2018 to 2021 -\\n2022 .
