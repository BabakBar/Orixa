I've created a comprehensive metrics automation system for GA4 analytics that focuses on key metrics for LLM analysis:

Key Metrics Structure:
Traffic Metrics:

Volume: pageviews, sessions, unique visitors
Quality: bounce rate, pages per session
Sources: traffic source distribution and performance
Engagement Metrics:

Session Quality: duration, depth, engagement rate
User Behavior: new vs returning, engagement patterns
Event Patterns: user interactions and conversions
Automation Components:
metrics_analyzer.py:

Extracts and structures all key metrics
Calculates derived metrics and patterns
Generates focused LLM prompts
automate_metrics.py:

Orchestrates the automation workflow
Analyzes patterns across metric categories
Prepares structured context for LLM
Generates actionable insights
The system is ready to process GA4 data from sample.csv and can be integrated with any LLM provider to generate automated insights. The metrics are structured to enable:

Pattern recognition in user behavior
Traffic quality assessment
Engagement optimization opportunities
Conversion funnel analysis
This provides a foundation for automated, data-driven insights that can be generated consistently across different time periods and websites.

starting prompt: 
i have a project making a demo that AI agents have some functionality like data analysis and webscraping. this project is using python, langchain, openai models and streamlit.
i want to strcuture my code here. as you see i have some buttons like "COMPETITOR CONTENT ANALYSIS" or "Start Data Analysis". i want each of these to do something in the backend and has it's own functionality. right now all the code in the demo.py file but we want to make each of these in it's own related case. for example i plan to create a webscraping logic later in the "COMPETITOR CONTENT ANALYSIS" or do something else functionality within "generate content" and further enhance the data analysis part. how to separate each logic and at the end have all of them working together to be usefull for the user and have everything in one place

# Caching
store and reuse the results of functions in streamlit st.cach_data

# visulization

ai recommend a few types of vizs that could be useful --> name & descriptions and also another option for users to choose

## Possible Approaches

1- Dynamic Chart Generation:
Allow users to select variables and chart types from dropdown menus.
Provide previews of different chart types (bar, line, scatter, heatmap, etc.) and let users choose their preferred visualization.

2- Automated Chart Suggestions:
Based on the dataset and selected variables, automatically suggest the most appropriate types of charts.
Use machine learning to recommend visualizations that highlight significant patterns and insights.
2.1- follow a structured approach --> select visualizations that provide meaningful insights into the dataset, addressing common business analysis needs and adhering to data visualization best practices.
2.1.1- Detailed Reasoning Process
- Dataset Familiarity:
Columns and Data Types: By examining the columns and their data types (sales, profit, quantity, discount, etc.), identified key metrics that are crucial for business insights.
Business Context: Understanding the business context (sales, customer segmentation, regional distribution) help in selecting relevant visualizations.
- Common Business Questions:
Performance Metrics: Sales and profit are primary performance metrics in most businesses.
Customer Segmentation: Analyzing different customer segments helps in understanding market behavior.
Geographic Analysis: Regional sales analysis is critical for market strategies.
Promotion Effectiveness: Examining the impact of discounts on profits can inform pricing strategies.
- Visualization Best Practices:
Histograms: Suitable for showing distribution of a continuous variable (sales).
Bar Charts: Effective for comparing totals across different categories (profit by category, sales by region, quantity by segment).
Scatter Plots: Useful for exploring relationships between two continuous variables (discount vs. profit).  (e.g., Plotly, Altair, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

3- Dashboard Approach:
Create a dashboard with multiple predefined visualizations that update based on user-selected variables.
Include key metrics, trend analysis, and comparisons in a single view.

4- Q&A Driven Visualizations:
Enable users to type questions in natural language, and generate visualizations based on the questions.
For example, if a user asks, "What is the sales trend over time?" a line chart showing sales over time is generated.

5- Interactive Exploration Tools:
Implement tools for users to interact with the visualizations, such as sliders for time ranges, filters for categorical variables, and drill-down options for detailed views.

6- Storytelling with Data:
Create a narrative flow where users can follow a guided tour of the data with step-by-step visualizations and insights.
Use text and visual elements to tell a compelling story about the data.



# Audience Insights: 
Customer understanding, segment comparison.
Data Collection
User Input: Direct input forms for user-provided details.
File Uploads: Allow users to upload relevant files (e.g., CRM exports, analytics data).
API Integration: Extract data from integrated tools like CRM systems and website analytics.
- Analysis and Insight Generation
AI Analysis: The AI agent analyzes provided data.
- Actionable Insights
Detailed Segments: Provide detailed marketing segments.
Insights: Generate actionable marketing insights.
Follow-up: Allow space for further conversation and follow-up questions.

Segmentation Skill: To define consumer segments. This skill might involve classification algorithms or heuristic rules that categorize consumers based on predefined criteria.

== Background

The goal of this project is to build an AI system based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to gather and analyze user data from various sources, including PDFs, pictures, and other file types. This system aims to provide detailed and actionable insights into customer understanding and segment comparison.

== Requirements

The AI system should fulfill the following requirements, categorized using the MoSCoW prioritization:

=== Must Have

User Input: Allow users to provide details through direct input forms.
File Uploads: Enable users to upload various file types (e.g., PDFs, pictures, CRM exports, analytics data).
API Integration: Extract data from integrated tools such as CRM systems and website analytics.
AI Analysis: The AI agent must analyze the provided data to generate insights.
Detailed Segments: Provide detailed marketing segments based on the analysis.
Actionable Insights: Generate and present actionable marketing insights.
=== Should Have

Follow-up: Allow space for further conversation and follow-up questions based on initial insights.
=== Could Have

Enhanced Segmentation: Utilize advanced classification algorithms or heuristic rules to define consumer segments.
=== Won't Have

Real-time data processing for this MVP.
