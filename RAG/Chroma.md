Implementing Chroma DB: A summarized step-by-step process
1. Get embeddings: Take the actions needed to convert words, images, or data into numbers and, specifically, vector representations.
2. Create collections: Create collections to group data like tables in a relational database.
3. Put data into collections: Save the data, like text and embeddings, in collections after preprocessing the data and generating vector embeddings.
4. Perform collection operations: Use Chroma DB to delete, change, or rename collections, among other actions, which gives you more ways to work with your data.
5. Use text or vector searches to find information to locate your answers based on semantic meaning or vector similarity, which is a useful way to get the most out of your data.
